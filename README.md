## About

I’m a **Senior Flutter & Android Engineer** with **7+ years** of experience
building production-grade mobile applications.

I focus on systems that are:

• simple to understand  
• scalable over time  
• maintainable by teams  
• calm under pressure  

Music plays an equal role in my life — it sharpens timing,
patience, and restraint. Those qualities show up directly
in how I design software.

- Architect scalable Flutter applications
- Apply Clean Architecture & SOLID principles
- Optimize performance & maintainability
- Build production-ready Android systems
- Create guitar + vocal music content

## Beyond Code

🎸 Guitar (acoustic & electric)  
🎤 Vocal performance  
🎧 Recording & arrangement aesthetics

Music and software share the same foundation:

**structure · timing · intentional silence**

## Philosophy

> Write code like music —  
> every line should have a reason to exist.
